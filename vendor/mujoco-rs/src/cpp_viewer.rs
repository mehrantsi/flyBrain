//! Wrapper around MuJoCo's original C++ viewer (also named Simulate).
//!
//! This module exposes [`MjViewerCpp`], which requires static linking against a patched MuJoCo
//! build. It is only available when the `cpp-viewer` Cargo feature is enabled.
//! For most use cases, the Rust-native [`crate::viewer::MjViewer`] is recommended instead.
